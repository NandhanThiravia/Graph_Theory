# Graph_Theory
My learning about Graph Theory Data Structures
1. Primitive representation of Graph using Adjacency List. [Graph]
2. Depth First Traversal (Non Recursive & for Disconnected Graphs). [Graph.depthFirstTraversal]
3. Breadth First Traversal (Non Recursive & for Disconnected Graphs) [Graph.breadthFirstTraversal]
4. Topological Sorting (Non Reursive). [Graph.topologicalSort]
5. Word Ladder Problem Solved - Shortest Chain Length to reach a target word given a start word and a list of words. [WordLadder]
6. Code to find number of Disconnected Graphs (also called as Islands in Graph) in the Input Graph data using BFS and DFS. [Graph.breadthFirstTraversal, Graph.depthFirstTraversal]
7. Shortest Distance from a given source code to every other node in a given graph. [Graph.shortestDistance]
