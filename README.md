# Graph_Theory
My learning about Graph Theory Data Structures:

Graph Class: It is based on Manually created Linked List. GraphTest Class has test Graphs.
Graph2 Class: It is based on built-in ArrayList Class. Looks simpler than Graph Class. Graph2Test Class has test Graphs.

1. Primitive representation of Graph using Adjacency List. [Graph2 / Graph]
2. Depth First Traversal (Non Recursive & for Disconnected Graphs). [Graph2.depthFirstTraversal / Graph.depthFirstTraversal]
3. Breadth First Traversal (Non Recursive & for Disconnected Graphs) [Graph2.breadthFirstTraversal | Graph.breadthFirstTraversal]
4. Topological Sorting (Non Reursive). [Graph2.topologicalSort | Graph.topologicalSort]
5. Word Ladder Problem Solved - Shortest Chain Length to reach a target word given a start word and a list of words. [WordLadder]
6. Code to find number of Disconnected Graphs (also called as Islands in Graph) in the Input Graph data using BFS and DFS. [Graph2.breadthFirstTraversal, Graph2.depthFirstTraversal | Graph.breadthFirstTraversal, Graph.depthFirstTraversal]
7. Shortest Distance from a given source code to every other node in a given graph. [Graph2.shortestDistance | Graph.shortestDistance]
8. Cycle Detection in Un-Directed Graph. [Graph2.isUndirectedCyclic | Graph.isCycleDetectedUndirected]
9. Cycle Detection in Directed Graph. [Graph.isCycleDetectedDirected]
10. Shortest Distance Algorithm - Breadth First Algorithm. [Graph.nonUnitShortestDistance]
11. Shortest Distance Algorithm - Topological Sorting Algorithm. [Graph.topoShortestDistance]
