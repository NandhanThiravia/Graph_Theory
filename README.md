# Graph_Theory
My learning about Graph Theory Data Structures
1. Primitive representation of Graph using Adjacency List
2. Depth First Traversal (Non Recursive)
3. Breadth First Traversal (Non Recursive)
4. Topological Sorting (Non Reursive)
5. Word Ladder Problem Solved - Shortest Chain Length to reach a target word given a start word and a list of words.
