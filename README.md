# Graph_Theory
My learning about Graph Theory Data Structures:

Graph Class: It is based on Manually created Linked List. GraphTest Class has test Graphs.
Graph2 Class: It is based on built-in ArrayList Class. Looks simpler than Graph Class. Graph2Test Class has test Graphs.

1. Primitive representation of Graph using Adjacency List. [Graph2 / Graph]
2. Depth First Traversal (Non Recursive & for Disconnected Graphs). [Graph2.depthFirstTraversal / Graph.depthFirstTraversal]
3. Breadth First Traversal (Non Recursive & for Disconnected Graphs) [Graph2.breadthFirstTraversal | Graph.breadthFirstTraversal]
4. Topological Sorting (Non Recursive). [Graph2.topologicalSort | Graph.topologicalSort]
5. Code to find number of Disconnected Graphs (also called as Islands in Graph) in the Input Graph data using BFS and DFS. [Graph2.breadthFirstTraversal, Graph2.depthFirstTraversal | Graph.breadthFirstTraversal, Graph.depthFirstTraversal]
6. Shortest Distance from a given source code to every other node in a given graph. [Graph2.shortestDistance | Graph.shortestDistance]
7. Cycle Detection in Undirected Graph. [Graph2.isDFSUndirectedCyclic | Graph.isCycleDetectedUndirected]
8. Cycle Detection in Directed Graph. [Graph2.isKahnDirectedCyclic | Graph.isCycleDetectedDirected]
9. Path Detection Algorithm. [Graph2.hasPath]
10. Find Level of a Given Node. [Graph2.displayLevel]
11. Find number of paths between 2 nodes [Graph2.countOfPath]
12. Minimum Spanning Tree - Prims Algorithm. [Graph2.minSpanningTree]



Other Puzzle Problems based on Graph:
1. Word Ladder Problem Solved - Shortest Chain Length to reach a target word given a start word and a list of words. [WordLadder]
2. Find Islands in a Array Matrix. [Islands.findIslands]
3. Find Path between 2 nodes. [PathFinder]
4. Find number of groups. [Grouping]
5. Find distance of each coordinate from nearest 1's. [Distance]
6. Find Mother Vertex in a Directed Graph. [MotherVertex]
7. Algorithm to find the Largest Unit Area in a Matrix containing 1s and 0s. [Area]
8. Algorithm to find the Time taken for the Fresh Oranges to Rot. [RottenOranges]
9. Algorithm to find the Minimum number of swaps required to sort the Array. [MinSwapToSort]
10. Algorithm to find shortest path for a Knight to reach Target in a Chess Board. [KnightProblem]
